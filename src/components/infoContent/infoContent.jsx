          <h3>1) Ancient Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Evidence suggests a 6-to-8.5 kilometer paved trackway (Diolkos) in Greece transported boats across the Isthmus of Corinth around 600 BCE.
            Wheeled vehicles pulled by humans and animals ran in limestone grooves.

          <h3>2) Pre-Steam (1500s-1800s)</h3>
          <p>
            Wooden rails were introduced with wagonways used in mines. Metal rails followed, with cast iron replaced by more durable wrought iron. The flanged wheel by John Curr revolutionized rail design.

          <h3>3) Steam Power (1800s-1900s)</h3>
          <p>
            The first full-scale steam locomotive was built in the UK by Richard Trevithick in 1804. The "Locomotion" by George Stephenson became the first public steam railway. Steam remained dominant for over a century.

          <h3>4) Electric Power (Late 1800s-Present)</h3>
          <p>
            The first electric locomotive, powered by batteries, was built by Robert Davidson in Scotland in 1837. Early electric trams emerged in the 1880s. Italian railways became the first to use electric traction for an entire main line in 1902.

          <h3>5) Diesel Power (1900s-Present)</h3>
          <p>
            Early examples of internal combustion engines appeared in the late 1800s, but the first successful diesel locomotive wasn't operational until 1912 in Switzerland. The development of a reliable electrical control system led to widespread adoption of diesel-electric locomotives.

          <h3>6) High-Speed Rail (1960s-Present)</h3>
          <p>
            Japan's Tokaido Shinkansen line became the first high-speed rail system in 1964, reaching speeds exceeding 300 km/h. High-speed rail has expanded to numerous countries, offering a faster and more sustainable alternative to air travel.

          <h3>The Beginnings:</h3>
            <p>
            Belgium took the lead in the Industrial Revolution on the Continent starting in the 1820s. 
            It provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the industrial 
            revolution. After splitting from the Netherlands in 1830, the new country decided to stimulate 
            industry. It planned and funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, 
            ports and mining areas and linked to neighboring countries. Unusually, the Belgian state became a 
            major contributor to early rail development and championed the creation of a national network with no 
            duplication of lines. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. Profits were low but the infrastructure 
            necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. The first railway in Belgium, running from northern Brussels 
            to Mechelen, was completed in May 1835.

          <h3>Country Differences:</h3>
            <p>
            The 2017 European Railway Performance Index ranked the performance of national rail systems as follows:

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>Tier One: Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Austria, Sweden, and France.</li>
                        <li>Tier Two: Great Britain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, the Czech Republic, Norway, Belgium, and Italy.</li>
                        <li> Tier Three: Lithuania, Slovenia, Ireland, Hungary, Latvia, Slovakia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Bulgaria.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            One of the main differences between the countries lays in the electrification of lines.
            <br></br>
            15 kV AC has been used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden since 1912, 
            while the Netherlands and France use 1500 V DC. France and Croatia also use 25 kV AC, 
            Belgium, Italy and Slovenia use 3 kV DC. All this makes the construction of truly 
            pan-European vehicles a challenging task and, until recent developments in locomotive construction, 
            was mostly ruled out as being impractical and too expensive. The development of an integrated European 
            high-speed rail network is overcoming some of these differences. All high-speed lines outside of Russia, 
            including those built in Spain and Portugal, use 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge tracks. Likewise 
            all European high-speed lines, outside of Germany, Austria and Italy use 25 kV AC electrification 
            (Electrification of high-speed rail in Italy is mixed 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC). This means that by 2020 
            high-speed trains can travel from Italy to the United Kingdom, or Portugal to the Netherlands without 
            the need for multi-voltage systems or breaks of gauge — or they could, if they didn't have to commute 
            from one high-speed line to the next over "classical" lines using a different voltage and/or frequency.
